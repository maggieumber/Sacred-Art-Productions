            <div class="litParagraphBlack">I never freeze in the dangers, the strangers <br>
              unseen and unheard, if I had a word<br>
              for the torrent of change this year has<br>
              brought, I ponder it all stacked with melanin<br>
              stacked black as the night sky<br>
              wrapped in intelligence, wrapped in elegance,<br>
              I am the living residence<br>
              Of a person that admired a hero<br>
              who fought his battles alone, who in the face<br>
              of danger became a symbol of freedom, of<br>
              power, of the royalty that's engrained in our DNA<br>
              Then I look back to my own power, the power<br>
              to access higher education<br>
              the potential of what I can amass in my area,<br>
              in my neighborhoods, in my life<br>
              when the world may call me a thug, punk,<br>
              gangsta, unworthy, uncrowned, denied, hopeless<br>
              It's because heros like him that aspires me<br>
              to be a scholar, provider, crowned in kindness,<br>
              a leader, aware, and understanding<br>
              I'll cross my arms and hold them to my chest,<br>
              Black Panther your soul lives on, be at peace<br>
              in your heavenly rest<br>

              Or the fire that sears<br>
              The generational wounds are reopening again<br>
              You can listen, you can cry, be angry, laugh<br>
              But I will never pray for my own downfall<br>
              My skin is an eternal marathon<br>
              That will outlast the marches<br>
              I will be protesting my entire life<br>
              Thousands were arrested to bring down four<br>

              4 years ago<br>

              The corner of a movement that long should be<br>
              heard<br>
              But we must continue to fight for better days<br>
              To burn bridges of hate<br>
              To operate under the systematic seams of woven<br>
              impressions on a different level<br>
              Small moves, big moves<br>
              You're moving, moving forward<br>
              Turn that into action: We got to keep painting the<br>

              In this aquatic distant sombering world called a<br>

          target="_blank">The Schizophrenic Dialogues</a> is a collection of memoirs on the first-hand experience of
        schizophrenia told through the lens of the actual dialogue between a person with schizophrenia and her auditory,
        visual, and tactile hallucinations. These accounts and their accompanying commentary represent the reality of
        people with schizophrenia in society and within themselves. The Dialogues shed light on the lives built to
        harness a stigmatized condition as a positive, and live in defiance of a "grave" prognosis.</p>

            <div class="litParagraphGray">
              I see you up there!<br>
              Peeking from beyond the clouds<br>
              you hide behind...<br>
              not knowing if you should show<br>
              your full face to let your light shine.<br>
              <br>
              Slowly, you emerge fully<br>
              out into the dark night sky.<br>
              It's ironic you bring me such delight<br>
              yet engender a yearning deep within me!<br>
              I want to hold onto your beauty;<br>
              the brightness you've shown me is<br>
              the only reason<br>
              I still have stars in my eyes.<br>

              it's a strange comfort to know you're always<br>
              there,<br>
              but I feel you may be lonely all the awy up<br>
              there...<br>
              Stuck in a perpetual dance around us<br>
              as our own personal satellite--<br>
              however it could be you're a shadow artist<br>
              and the Earth is simply your muse.<br>
              Going through phases only to see<br>
              the various ways we look from afar<br>

              a way of life.<br>
              At least for the human race<br>
              as we destroy our home and<br>
              each other at a break-neck pace.<br>
              Humans living with hardly<br>
              any "humanity"...<br>
              wondering why we can't<br>
              seem to get ahead when<br>
              we only look behind...<br>
              Even when we look outside<br>
              towards the others,<br>
              we all realize we can barely survive.<br>
              All of our hearts drop at the realization<br>
              that we've been promoting violence,<br>
              condoning hate, and even loving strife.<br>

              innately embedded in all of us...<br>
              A faint and common vibration gently shakes<br>
              our heartstrings, giving us the illusion of<br>
              feeling <strong>EVERYTHING</strong>--then maybe<br>
              nothing.<br>
              <br>
              What a tricky thing to exist, to <em>feel</em>, even...<br>
              Our perspectives largely determine what we<br>
              experience in this sensate world<br>
              as events and emotions all blur together to<br>
              form our chaotic everyday lives,<br>

              I remember being young<br>
              thinking I was just like<br>
              a hurricane--even wrote a<br>
              poem likening myself to the<br>
              infamous storm.<br>
              <br>
              What I didn't realize in my naive<br>
              youth is I was not so much like<br>
              the storm as<br>
              I am the eye of the storm.<br>
              I am not merely the chaos I feel<br>
              surrounded by;<br>
              I am also the peace I know is<br>
              deep within me.<br>
              <br>
              I cannot always see the blue<br>
              sky when it is overcast,<br>
              yet I can always focus being<br>
              more the eye of my own storm<br>
              as I perpetuate heavy showers.<br>
              <br>
              Perhaps I am just trying<br>
              to cleanse this soul<br>
              from all the toxicity<br>
              it used to hold so dear.<br>
